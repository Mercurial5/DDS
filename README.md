# DDS

## Booting up

In order to boot up the project, run:

```
docker compose up -d
```

and visit [localhost](http://localhost:8000).

## Notes

This project could've been written with onion architecture, but since it doesn't
have much functionality, it was written without patterns to not overcomplicate things.
